Tool that helps convert macOS preferences to bash commands. I initially wanted to save some of my macOS preferences as bash commands so I can use them in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/ZhongXiLu/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/yadm/bootstrap.d/macos.sh) and whenever I would have to setup a new macOS environment, I can easily import my macOS preferences.

# How to Install

This is only for macOS of course ðŸ˜‰

### Download executable

- Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/ZhongXiLu/goplist/releases/latest) and download the `goplist` executable.
- Make `goplist` executable: `chmod +x goplist`
- Run `goplist` with `./goplist -h`

### Build locally

Alternatively you can build it yourself:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:ZhongXiLu/goplist.git
cd goplist
go install
goplist -h
```

# How to Run

- Simply run `goplist` in any directory and it will record any changes to your preferences. Note that it may take some time for the OS to write your changes to disk. If you want to keep your current preference, simply toggle (with a small delay in between them) and `goplist` will remember your last choice. After you are done, simply press <kbd>ctrl + c</kbd> and `goplist` will write your preferences to file (by default `macos.sh`).
- Run `goplist -h` for help.
- Currently, `goplist` is *experimental* and might not always work ðŸ˜›

- This also works for some other applications, e.g. [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/):
